# Bitcoinlib

This is a port of the code from [Jimmy Songs`s Programming Bitcoin]() into golang.

Most of the things are implemented in a similar way, although some design changes where made.

Tests where taken mostly from the examples found in the book and sometimes directly from Jimmy`s test in the repo. (This means that there are probably many missing tests)
